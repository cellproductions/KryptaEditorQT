BUGS:
* flip x/y of tile positions (crash from exporting, rectangle maps are the wrong way around)
* apply all is broken (hasn't been updated)
* weird bug when changing an object's animation, copying it, then selecting that object from the entity list makes that object's skin change to the copy's skin'
* creating a new map while there is already a map makes everything disappear
* toolbar options for tools dont remove properly (what's up Qt?)
* some tile icons appear as missing.png, dunno why

TO TEST:
* press the animate button and dont stop it while switching tabs/animations
*
