BUGS:
* flip x/y of tile positions (crash from exporting, rectangle maps are the wrong way around)
* apply all is broken in the object settings dialog (hasn't been updated)
* creating a new map while there is already a map makes everything disappear (wot)
* wall icons appear as missing.png only on the first time editing it (wot)
* right clicking on waypoints is off by a hundred or so? not sure
* crash when deleting a frame from an animation
* crash when deleting an animation
* can set a pivot in animations without being in pivot mode
* selection tool suddenly broke (probably has something to do with switching the vec2is to fs)
* after cancelling an environment piece creation, it still gets added
* selection quad wont dissapear when releasing the mouse button

OPTIMIZATIONS:
* object placement during painting (especially on large maps, investigate)
* selection using box selection

TO TEST:
* press the animate button and dont stop it while switching tabs/animations
*
